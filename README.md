Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on a set of product reviews. The sentiment of each review is labeled as either positive or negative. The text data is preprocessed using SpaCy for lemmatization, then transformed into TF-IDF features. The following machine learning models are implemented:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
Each model is fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters and improve performance. The models are then saved and can be used for prediction in a real-world scenario.

Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using the following command: git clone https://github.com/saisarath13/Sentiment_Analysis_Multimodel.git Then, navigate to the project folder: cd Sentiment_Analysis_Multimodel

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

Run python -m venv venv
For activating the environment, use:
On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install the necessary dependencies with: pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the SpaCy model for preprocessing with: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Usage
After setting up the environment and installing the dependencies, you can run the Jupyter notebook to see the complete implementation or use the Python script to directly execute the sentiment analysis.

Running the Sentiment Analysis
To train and evaluate the models, run the following command: python main.py

This will:

Train models with hyperparameter tuning.
Save the models to disk.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Predict Sentiment
To make predictions, you can call the predict_sentiment() function by providing a review text as input. For example:

python
Copy code
text_input = 'I really enjoy using this product, it's fantastic!'
predictions = predict_sentiment(text_input)
print(predictions)

Models & Tuning
This project utilizes several machine learning models to perform sentiment analysis. Each model is fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to determine the optimal hyperparameters.

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Hyperparameters tuned: C, kernel, class_weight
Best hyperparameters are chosen using GridSearchCV with cross-validation.
Logistic Regression

Hyperparameters tuned: C, solver, max_iter
Fine-tuned using GridSearchCV for optimal regularization and solver parameters.
Random Forest

Hyperparameters tuned: n_estimators, max_depth, class_weight
GridSearchCV used to find the best values for tree depth and class balancing.
XGBoost

Hyperparameters tuned: max_depth, learning_rate, n_estimators, subsample, colsample_bytree, scale_pos_weight
The XGBoost model is trained with GridSearchCV for better handling of class imbalance and overfitting.
Results
Each model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The performance of each model is compared, and the best-performing model can be selected for further deployment.

Example Output:
SVM Accuracy: 0.85
Confusion Matrix:
[[13 2] [ 3 12]]
Classification Report:
Precision	Recall	F1-Score	Support
Negative	0.81	0.87	0.84	15
Positive	0.86	0.80	0.83	15
